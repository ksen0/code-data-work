<h1>Consider Data Cleaning</h1>

<p>Do you do code/data work, for some data-driven or AI system? How much time do you spend cleaning data?</p>

<p>If you answer "too much", shake your head, and feel kind of frustrated or ambivalent about it, I invite you to:</p>

<p><ol>
    <li>Imagine a perfect world, with respect to how code/data systems are designed, developed, and maintained.</li>
    <li>Consider: how much time do you spend cleaning data in this perfect world, and how do you feel about it?</li>
</ol>

<h2>1. DATA WORK</h2>


<p>The perfect world includes credit, recognition, and compensation for all seen and unseen labor needed for code/data systems. In addition to data cleaning, which is often done by code workers or code/data workers, other types of data labor are essential. However, these tasks are systematically, broadly, and “profoundly undervalued in proportion to the knowledge it helps to create” [1, pp. 180-184].</p>

<p>Critiquing the message of The Second Machine Age, Dr. Lilly Irani writes that the book’s authors “ignore the labor of cultural data workers, as if algorithms trained, tuned, and augmented themselves, like magic.” (Irani, 2016) The “training data” demanded by artificial intelligence; the “content moderation” or “curation” tasks; "raters” to judge output of automated systems. Human-generated data is fed back to the algorithms.</p>

<p>Referencing a different book, Mindless, Irani continues that the problem is not with automation per se, but rather "with the ways automation entrenches command-and-control relationships between managers and workers” [2]. Controlled and controllable micro-tasks fail to engage with “a wide range of accumulated human ability and wisdom,” or to “generate more subtle kinds of value” [2].
The perfect world, I think, includes not only credit for data work, but also a re-imagining of what kinds of how this essential data work is structured. This means reconsidering how the attendant code work relates to revision.</p>

<h2>2. BETTER REVISION</h2>

<p>In Algorithms of Oppression [3], Dr. Safiya Umoja Noble details example after example of search engines being claimed to be neutral and/or inscrutable; and then, after sufficient pressure, being revised.</p>

<p>The fact that all contemporary AI systems cannot exist without data work, but that this fact is intentionally hidden from view, contributes to the myth that code/data systems can possibly be unbiased. It also contributes to the myth that a code/data system can “just run” without repeated interrogation and revision.</p>

<div style="width:20%; max-width:300px;float:left;padding-right:50px;padding-bottom:30px;padding-top:30px;text-align: right"><strong>A CODE/DATA SYSTEM CANNOT “JUST RUN” WITHOUT REPEATED INTERROGATION AND REVISION</strong></div>

<p>Which brings me back to data cleaning. I think in a perfect world, data cleaning is an aspect of code work that is intentionally repeated, and balances automation and human interpretation. This allows more complex (and more human) data collection and feedback mechanisms for training systems. It normalizes finding and revising problematic behavior by automated systems.</p>


<p>Data cleaning is not only unavoidable, but each round of repeated care of data and code is an opportunity to invite new perspectives to code/data technical objects, to practice accountability, inclusion, and other values recognised as essential over time.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, I spend a lot of time on tasks that look like data cleaning and preparation, and I feel great about it! Rather than feeling adversarial unease about imperfect, suspect labels, I feel curiosity. Embracing cleaning tasks creates space to interrogate the problems I work on: not as an exception, but as the routine.</p>
